# 💻 Decision Making in C++

## 🎯 Aim  
To explore key decision-making structures in C++ including if else, if else if ladder, and switch case through foundational examples like checking odd or even, finding the largest of three numbers, identifying vowels or consonants, and using switch statements.

## 📚 Theory

- Conditional statements control the flow of execution based on evaluated conditions, allowing for dynamic and flexible logic handling.  
- These constructs are crucial for enabling programs to “think” and respond to input or state variations.

## 🔄 If Else Statement

The if else structure allows a program to make a binary decision.  
If a condition evaluates as true, one block of code is executed; otherwise, the alternate block runs.  
It is useful for simple yes or no logic checks where you’re choosing between two distinct paths.

---

## 🧭 If Else If Else Ladder

This expands decision making to multiple conditions.  
The program evaluates conditions sequentially from top to bottom.  
As soon as one condition is true, its corresponding block runs and the rest are skipped.  
The final else acts as a fallback if none of the prior conditions match.  
Ideal for layered logic where multiple outcomes are possible.

## 🎚️ Switch Case Statement

The switch case structure offers a cleaner alternative to multiple if checks when you're dealing with discrete values such as menu options or fixed states.  
It matches the value of a variable against predefined cases and executes the matched case block.  
A default case handles anything that doesn’t fit the listed options.

## 📋 Algorithms

### ✅ Odd or Even Number Detection

1. Start  
2. Declare an integer variable `num`  
3. Prompt the user to enter a number  
4. Input the number into `num`  
5. Check if `num % 2 == 0`  
   - If true → Display "Even"  
   - Else → Display "Odd"  
6. End

---

### ✅ Largest of Three Numbers

1. Start  
2. Declare three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c`  
3. Prompt the user to enter all three numbers  
4. Input the values  
5. Compare:  
   - If `a > b && a > c` → Display `a` is largest  
   - Else if `b > c` → Display `b` is largest  
   - Else → Display `c` is largest  
6. End

---

### ✅ Vowel or Consonant Using ASCII

1. Start  
2. Declare a character variable `ch`  
3. Prompt the user to enter a character  
4. Input `ch`  
5. Check if `ch` is between `'A'` to `'Z'` or `'a'` to `'z'` (ASCII 65–90 or 97–122)  
   - If true → Check if `ch` is `'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'` or lowercase equivalents  
     - If true → Display "Vowel"  
     - Else → Display "Consonant"  
   - Else → Display "Not a letter"  
6. End

---

### ✅ Month Selector Using Switch Case

1. Start  
2. Declare an integer variable `choice`  
3. Display menu options for months (1 to 12)  
4. Prompt the user to enter a choice  
5. Input `choice`  
6. Use `switch(choice)`  
   - Match cases from 1 to 12 to corresponding month  
   - If no match → Display "Invalid Input"  
7. End

## 🧠 Conclusion

Decision making is at the heart of intelligent programming.  
Whether you're branching logic with if else, scaling conditions with else if ladders, or simplifying options via switch case, mastering these structures equips you to write smarter and more dynamic code.  
Let the compiler follow your logic line by line, decision by decision.
